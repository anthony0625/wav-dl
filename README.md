wav-dl is a tool for downloading and converting audio files from YouTube playlists. With wav-dl, you can convert YouTube playlists of any size into a series of high-quality WAV audio files, with each file corresponding to a video in the playlist.

## Installation

To use wav-dl, download the latest release from the wav-dl GitHub repository and extract the contents of the archive. Then, navigate to the directory containing the executable file and run the following command:

`./wav-dl` 

You will be prompted with the playlist link and directory to save the WAV files to. wav-dl will automatically download each video in the playlist and convert it to a WAV audio file, with the file name based on the video title. See the examples below for what an example input might look like.
